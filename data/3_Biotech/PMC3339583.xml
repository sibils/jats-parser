Once released into the environment, fate and toxicity of these metallic contaminants are strongly regulated by abiotic and biotic components such as minerals and bacteria (Lloyd and Renshaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). On the other hand, the toxic and bioavailable forms of these metals and radionuclides often affect adversely the diversity and function of autochthonous microorganisms of neighboring habitats that bequeath ecological sustains by maintaining biogeochemical cycles (Torsvik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>; Islam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>). Diversity and distribution of microbes is often site-specific, influenced by composition of geochemical matrix of microhabitats. Perturbation to this due to environmental contamination could cause change in inhabitant microbial community structure, diversity and function (Herrera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>; Desai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). In order to gauge the impact of environmental contamination, microbial community composition and diversity are increasingly being considered as highly sensitive ecological parameters (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>; Desai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Islam and Sar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011b</xref>). Therefore, studies on diversity and composition of indigenous microbial communities within sites having high risk of contamination may serve as baseline information to assess the subsequent impact of contamination.</p><p>In the recent years, advances in culture-based and -independent molecular approaches have elucidated microbial diversity and function in sites contaminated with radioactive wastes or wastes generated from uranium, copper and zinc mines. These studies have revealed the presence of diverse (phylogenetically and metabolically) populations of viable and active microorganisms organized in complex communities (Radeva and Selenska-Pobell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>; Akob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Rastogi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>). Particularly, the abundance of <italic>Acidithiobacillus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter</italic>, <italic>Nitrosomonas</italic> was observed in various U mine waste sites in Germany (Radeva and Selenska-Pobell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>), while high abundance of <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (<italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, <italic>Acidovorax</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> and <italic>Ralstonia</italic>) was reported from U-contaminated radioactive waste (Akob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>). Recently, Rastogi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>) has reported abundance of <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> and <italic>Bacteriodetes</italic> in a U mine impacted site in USA. Studies conducted in our laboratory have revealed microbial communities within two U mines (Jaduguda and Banduhurang) along with potential of inhabitant bacteria in U and other metal resistance and sequestration and impact of U ore contamination on soil microbial diversity (Sar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>; Choudhary and Sar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>; Islam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>; Islam and Sar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">b</xref>). With vast genetic and metabolic diversity, these microorganisms were found to interact with metals and radionuclides directly or indirectly by redox transfer, biosorption, bioaccumulation or bioprecipitation affecting their environmental mobility and toxicity (Suzuki and Banfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000</xref>; Tabak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>; Nedelkova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>). Considering the significance of geomicrobiology of contaminated sites, it is therefore imperative to decipher phylogenetic diversity of indigenous microbial populations in sites having high risk of contamination or already contaminated to illuminate community resilience, their potential role in affecting metal biogeochemistry and in designing appropriate bioremediation strategies (Tabak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>; Akob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>).</p><p>Uranium mines at Jaduguda, Bagjata, and Turamdih are all located in highly mineral-rich areas of East Singhbhum district, Jharkhand, India. Jaduguda mine is the oldest U mine in India operating since 1968, while the other two mines are commissioned relatively recently (2002&#x02013;2003) (Gupta and Sarangi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>). Present work was undertaken to ascertain diversity and structure of bacterial communities within sites in and around these U mines as a means to obtain the baseline data on microbial diversity. Sites contaminated with U-ores/-mine wastes as well as sites located away from such contaminants (ores and wastes; especially, agriculture fields, streams, etc. located outside the mine areas) were considered. Samples collected from all these sites were analyzed for their physicochemical properties (pH, conductivity, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and heavy metal content). Culturable bacterial counts were recorded and finally the compositions of microbial communities were determined at molecular level with the determination of diversity indices and identification of dominant ribotypes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Collection of samples</title><p>Soil, water and sediment samples were collected from various locations of proposed and existing uranium mines of at Jaduguda (N 22&#x000b0;39&#x02032;, E 86&#x000b0;20&#x02032;), Bagjata (N 22&#x000b0;28&#x02032;, E 86&#x000b0;29&#x02032;), and Turamdih (N 22&#x000b0;43&#x02032;, E 86&#x000b0;11&#x02032;). Samples B209, B210, B211, B214, B218 and T112, T219, T221, T222 were collected from agriculture field; pond and small streams located outside the boundary of Bagjata and Turamdih mines, respectively, and are designated as non-contaminated samples.

Heavy metals and actinide elements were estimated by ICP-MS (Varian) and/or AAS (Perkin-Elmer). Culturable microbial populations were enumerated by CFU counts using R2A medium. Measured quantities of samples were dispersed in sterile saline (0.9%), shake (1&#x000a0;h), diluted and plated in triplicate on R2A medium.

As evident from the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, samples were mostly having near neutral pH (except a few, e.g., B209, B210, T112, T222 with relatively lower pH and CW2 having an alkaline pH). Conductivity of the contaminated samples showed considerably higher values (955&#x02013;4,340&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s/cm) than that of non-contaminated samples (10&#x02013;244) (data not shown). It was observed that overall nutrient (TOC, TN and TP) content in contaminated samples, particularly in CW1 and CW3, was relatively higher than other contaminated and even non-contaminated samples. Microbiological counts as obtained by CFU counts were higher in few samples like B218, T221, CW1 and CW3. Heavy metal content as analyzed in non-contaminated samples indicated that for the elements tested the concentrations were within the limits for background concentrations of trace elements estimated in non-anthropogenic soils (Burt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>). Level of Th was found to be within a relatively narrow range of 3&#x02013;17&#x000a0;mg/kg across all the samples tested. Concentrations of metals like Co, Ni and Zn were considerably higher in contaminated samples (over the non-contaminated counterparts) exceeding the values reported for non-anthropogenic soils or matches well with those reported for anthropogenically contaminated soils (Burt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>). Uranium, though present in several non-contaminated samples as well, was present at elevated level in two contaminated samples (CW1 and CW2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Noticeably, in all three non-contaminated samples simultaneous presence of three or more metals (including U) at higher concentrations was observed. Presence of U and other metals in non-contaminated samples could be explained considering the fact that this whole region is highly mineral-rich and natural weathering may easily enrich the soil and other parts with metals (Sarangi and Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Geomicrobial properties of the samples</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2011_34_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e549"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Analysis of heavy metals and radionuclides (U and Th) content within the samples</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2011_34_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e558"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>16S rRNA gene clone library analysis and bacterial diversity indices</title><p>For analyzing bacterial diversity nearly 50 or 100 clones were used to construct individual clone library for each sample. Based on ARDRA profiles, statistical analysis was followed to determine the bacterial diversity within these samples. Interestingly, all three contaminated samples showed relatively higher Shannon diversity indices (<italic>H</italic>) but the equitability value (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub>) varied considerably among the samples [B209 (2.88, 0.71), B210 (3.0, 0.93), B211 (2.77, 0.89), B214 (2.48, 0.63), B218 (2.99, 0.94), T112 (3.22, 0.95), T219 (3.52, 0.97), T221 (2.6, 0.70), T222 (2.9, 0.95), CW1 (3.65, 0.92), CW2 (3.51, 0.89) and CW3 (3.69, 0.92)]. Based on diversity result, we inferred that high nutrient content of the samples possibly make the heavy metal contamination as less stressful event as the inhabitant bacterial members might be nutritionally well supported to withstand metal toxicity. Nevertheless, near neutral pH may allow formation of relatively insoluble metal complexes for most cations thereby reducing their availability as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sequence analysis and affiliation of major ribotypes</title><p>Compositions of bacterial communities within the samples were ascertained by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences of major ribotypes from each library (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Particularly, sequences from non-contaminated samples showed a strong similarity with uncultured <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> from undisturbed mixed grass prairie and rice field soils. In contrast, <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> sequences retrieved from contaminated samples showed high similarity with uncultured clones mostly obtained from hydrocarbon-contaminated soil and sediment, soil adjacent to silage storage bunker and Altamira cave, etc. In order to determine the distribution of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> sequences retrieved from ten clone libraries into different subgroups, a Neighbor-joining tree was constructed using representative <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> sequences of different subgroups along with our sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Representative sequences for various subgroups were obtained from previously published works of Sait et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</xref> (subgroup 1) and Hugenholtz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref> (subgroup 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). Hugenholtz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref>) mentioned that <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> subdivisions 1, 3, 4, and 6 are well represented by environmental clone sequences with only five cultured representatives. In this regard, our analysis indicated that members of subgroup 1, 3, 4 and 5 were present within all eight libraries. Members that belong to other subgroups (2, 6, 7 and 8) were not detected in the present libraries. Phylogenetic tree further revealed that the most dominant <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> clones from libraries B209, B210, T219, T221 and TD222 were present within subgroup 1. Within this subgroup, seven sequences representing the major ribotypes from the above libraries were included. Sequence of the clone B210-44 although shared identity with an uncultured bacterium, showed a close phylogenetic lineage with culturable representative <italic>Acidobacterium capsulatumi</italic> with 90% bootstrap value. The next cluster that accommodated maximum numbers of ribotypes showed their affiliation to subgroup 4. In this subgroup, four <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> clones from the contaminated site CW1, and three from non-contaminated sites (T112, B209 and B210) were included. Subgroup 5 was composed of four dominant <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> clones; two retrieved from contaminated library CW3 and other two from non-contaminated library T112. Subgroup 3 was represented by members from the library T222. Abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> in uranium-contaminated samples was reported by Barns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>. The ubiquity and abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> in soils and their ability to withstand polluted and extreme environments suggest that they serve functions important in the environment and are potentially quite varied (Ward et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Proteobacteria</title><p>Predominance of phylum <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> was observed mainly in contaminated samples, although their presence was detected within non-contaminated samples as well. Among the <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, members of the class <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic> was found to represent the abundant ribotypes in contaminated as well as non-contaminated samples. As evident from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, within the contaminated samples nine ribotypes of CW3 library (42% coverage), five ribotypes (29% coverage) from CW2 library and two ribotypes (11% coverage) of library CW1 were affiliated to <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. Several major ribotypes from non-contaminated samples (B18, B211 and B214) were belonging to <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. As evident from the tree topology, three clones (CW3-63, CW3-161 and CW3-52) from CW3 formed a separate monophyletic clade showing their relatedness with thiosulfate oxidizing autotrophic bacterium <italic>Thiobacillus thioparus</italic> (ATCC 8158).

In the same clade clone, CW3-136 and CW3-166 of library CW3 showed strong phylogenetic affiliation and lineage (100% bootstrap support) with nickel-resistant <italic>Massilia timonae</italic> (AY512824). Clone CW3-12 showed a strong affiliation with uncultured <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (EF492892) isolated from soil around iron-manganese nodule from China. Other clones in the same library formed a single clade showing their affiliation with hydrocarbon degrader <italic>Propionivibrio limicola</italic> (AJ307983). Clone CW2-44 and CW3-25 showed affiliation with perchlorate-reducing bacterium <italic>Dechloromonas</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> LT-1 (AY124797) and denitrifying <italic>Azonexus fungiphilus</italic> (AF011350), respectively. Clone B214-3, the most abundant ribotype (covering 22%) of the library B218 formed a monophyletic node showing close relatedness with &#x02018;nanometric&#x02019; bacterium <italic>Ramlibacter tataouinensis</italic> (AF144383) isolated from meteorite-impacted subdesert soil in Tunisia, France. The other node was comprised six clones. Clones B218-167 and B211-10 of this cluster showed a strong affiliation with uncultured <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (AY921995). Clone CW3-167 showed affiliation with cholesterol-oxidizing, denitrifying bacterium <italic>Sterolibactrium denitrificans</italic> (AJ306683). In another clade, two clones CW1-8 and CW1-78 together covering 11% of the CW1 library showed affiliation with <italic>Methylibium</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> (EU130974) isolated from granular activated carbon filters. Along with clones CW2-75 and CW2-162 having relatedness with <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> bacterium YT0099, the later clones showed a strong lineage with members of <italic>Burkholderiaceae</italic> capable of redox transformation of metals to satisfy metabolic requirements. Sequence of clone CW3-88 formed a separate clade showing its distinctness from other members but strong phylogenetic lineage (99% bootstrap value) with uncultured <italic>Alcaligenaceae</italic> (AM936094) isolated from hydrocarbon contaminated soil. Members of the class <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic> were relatively more abundant in contaminated samples. Sequence of clone B218-15 was highly related to an uncultured member of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. Two clones (CW2-3 and CW2-128 covering 21% of CW2 library), showed a strong phylogenetic affiliation with arsenic-resistant soil bacterium (AF308875). Sequence of clone B210-14 marked its affiliation with uncultured <italic>Xanthomonadace</italic> bacterium, while two clones CW1-36 and CW3-45 showed their lineage to polychlorinated dioxin dechlorinating bacterium. Members of the class <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic> were represented by ribotypes from contaminated samples CW2 and CW3, covering 25 or 27% in respective libraries. Within this class, sequences of clones CW2-52 and CW2-77 showed a strong relatedness with N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria <italic>Azospirillum amazonense.</italic> Sequences of clones CW3-33 and CW1-36 showed phylogenetic affiliation with uncultured bacterium isolated from floor dust. Together with sequence of CW2-29, both these two clades were found to be related sharing the same node, thus indicating a common phylogenetic origin. The remaining clade within this class was composed of five clones. Clone CW3-130 and CW3-147 (covering 7% of the CW3 library) showed affiliation with mixed grass bacterium where as clone CW2-100 showed affiliation with <italic>Microvirga</italic> sp. (EU529844) isolated from soil of cucumber farming greenhouse. Sequence of clone CW2-140 showed a strong affiliation with <italic>Parvibaculum lavamentivorans</italic> (AY387398) bacterium capable of alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactant (LAS) biodegradation. Sequences of three other clones CW3-133, CW3-20 and CW3-11, although strongly related to each other showed phylogenetic affiliation with uncultured bacterium isolated from a poplar tree microcosm. Class <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>-<italic>Proteobacteria</italic> was represented by two clones (B218-10 and B211-9). Sequence of clone B218-10 was the most abundant ribotype in library B218 that showed affiliation with <italic>Desulfovibrio alkalitolerans</italic> (AY649785) isolated from a heating water of Denmark. Dominancy of <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> in contaminated sites is well reported (Rastogi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>; Ellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>). Lineages belonging to <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> are well known to survive in oligotrophic environments, capable of metal reduction and resistance and play very important roles in uranium immobilization in contaminated sediments or groundwater.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Cyanobacteria</title><p>Members of these phyla were more abundant in non-contaminated samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> was represented by five ribotypes. Sequence of clone B209-3 showed a strong phylogenetic lineage (100% bootstrap value) with <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> sp. (EU194891) while clone (B211-39) showed a strong affiliation with uncultured bacterium isolated from gold mine tailings of Nederland. Clone CW2-129 showed affiliation with <italic>Sediminibacterium</italic> sp. (FM179320) where as clone CW1-57 showed affiliation with uncultured bacterium isolated from a waste-gas biofilter. Presence of the phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> in heavy metal and uranium-contaminated soils and sediments were reported previously by Ellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>; Reardon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>; Brodie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref> and Akob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>.</p><p>Phylum <italic>Cyanobacteria</italic> was represented by eight clones. Among the four clones from non-contaminated sites, three from library T219 showed lineage with <italic>Oscillatoria duplisecta</italic> (AM398647) isolated from a thermal mud of Euganean thermal springs (Italy). Clone CW2-104 from sample CW2 also showed affiliation with <italic>Oscillatoria acuminata</italic> (AB039014). Other three clones (CW2-96, CW2-34 and CW2-35) from contaminated sample CW2, covering 11% of the clone library, and showed affiliation with uncultured <italic>Chlorophyta</italic> chloroplast 16S rRNA gene (AB374385). <italic>Cyanobacteria</italic> were the ubiquitous group present in most soil habitats and possessing high tolerance to environmental stress (Chong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). Our results indicated that it may be present both in contaminated and non-contaminated samples. It also can act as a biosorbent of heavy metals in sewage water (El-Enany and Issa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>). Phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> was represented by four clones. Clone B211-27 showed a strong phylogenetic affiliation (100% bootstrap value) with <italic>Firmicutes</italic> bacterium isolated from Pere Marquette River sediment. Clone B219-8, CW3-144 and CW3-138 showed a strong phylogenetic affiliation (100% bootstrap value) with Manganese (II)-oxidizing <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. Akob et al. <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>) showed the presence of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in radionuclide-contaminated subsurface sediments during the early part of the ethanol microcosm incubation suggesting that these groups may have actively involved in nitrate reduction and subsequent uranium reduction both important for the immobilization of U(VI) in contaminated sediments. Merroun et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>) showed that <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., can be recovered from uranium mining waste pile and can make complexion with uranium by either whole cells or S-Layer sheets. Phylum <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> was mainly represented by ribotypes from sample B214. Sequences of clone B214-22 and B214-6 formed a distinct monophyletic clade along with <italic>Anaerolinea thermolimosa</italic> (AB109437) isolated from thermophilic granular sludge. Phylum <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Nitrospira</italic> and <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> were all represented by single ribotype. In the phylum <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, clone CW2-97 was found to be phylogenetically affiliated (with 100% bootstrap value) with <italic>Cellulomonadaceae</italic> str. KB8 isolated from paddy rice. Clone B209-18 showed a strong phylogenetic affiliation with nitrite oxidizing <italic>Nitrospira moscoviensis</italic>. In the phylum <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic>, clone CW1-14 showed affiliation with uncultured bacterium isolated from oil palm empty fruit bunches compost heap.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors acknowledge the financial support from Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Govt. of India.
